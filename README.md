# Cancer Cell Analysis via Linear Regression
This Jupyter Notebook uses Python to implement a linear regression machine learning model that can used to predict the malignancy of a cancer cell based on its observed attributes. The data used for training and testing the model was sourced from a publicly available dataset of cancer cells and their features (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data/data).

You can see the model in action by generating predictions using randomized cancer cell data at the bottom of the notebook.
